# Time-lapse exposure fixing tool
Time-lapse photography is a popular technique taking a sequence of frames at set intervals to record changes that take place in a scene over time. This photographic technique is popularly used nowadays, especially on video-sharing websites such as YouTube. This simple tool is an idea (and excuse) of mine to get familiar with Qt for graphical user interfaces as well as OpenCV for image processing.

Common problems in time-lapse photography arise from exposure changes in the camera settings or even natural light changes in a scene. This tool's goal is to fix exposure cahnges in time-lapse videos, which are formed from a sequence of photographs.

Note: this tool can also be used for stop-motion animations to fix changing light in the scene.
